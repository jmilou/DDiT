# DDiT
## Debris DIsks Tool

![screenshot](screenshots/DDiT.png)

A Python code to (quickly) produce synthetic images of debris disks, in total and polarized intensity using the Henyey-Greenstein approximation. In the model, the disk is not infinitely flat and it should work for any inclinations except for `i=0` or `i=90` (otherwise there may be some division by zero).

### Installation and first try

To use the module, download the python files above and install it with the following (using the `develop` option so that any further changes are automatically included):
```python
python3 setup.py develop
```

Given that the code only uses matplotlib and numpy, it should work with python2 and python3. To compute a model, you can have a look at the end of the "DDiT.py" file, but in a nutshell, it is as simple as

```python
from DDiT import Disk
disk = Disk()
disk.compute_model(a = 0.6, i = 60., e = 0.3)
```

Alternatively, if you do not want to pass the arguments to the function (let's say you want to do some MCMC and want some liberty in choosing the free parameters), you can also do the following:

```python
from DDiT import Disk
disk = Disk()
disk.a = 0.6 # in units of arcseconds
disk.i = 60. * np.pi / 180.
disk.e = 0.3
disk.compute_model()
```
But in that case, you have to make sure that you put the angles in radians (and check the method `_check_parameters` to see how the position angle is defined). Once the model is computed, you will find the images in the variables `disk.intensity` and `disk.polarized` for the total and polarized intensity. Furthermore, in `disk.scattering`, `disk.distance`, and `disk.azimuth` you will have access to the scattering angle, the distance to the star, and the azimuthal angle, in the midplane.

### Description of the code

The way the code works is that it first finds a bounding box where most of the dust density distribution is contained. This bounding box, which is a 3D ellipse, is computed from the reference radius, the outer slope of the density distribution, and the eccentricity. Then, for each row of pixels perpendicular to the major axis of the disk (`x` axis), the `y` and `z` coordinates for the entry and exit points of the bounding box are estimated. The distance between the entry and exit points is divided in `nframe` images, and the 3D coordinates at the center of each cell are computed. The radial and vertical volumetric density are evaluated at the center of the grids, as well as the scattering angle, to compute the scattered light contribution. The final image is the sum of all those `nframe` images. The process is highlighted in the animation below.

### Input parameters

The `Disk` class has three possible parameters which are the following:

```python
nx = 300             # Size of the image in pixels
pixelscale = 0.01226 # Size of on pixel in arcseconds
nframe = 50          # Number of frames (see above)
```

Both values of `nframe` and `nx` should be integers, and `nx` should be an even number. Once the class is called for the first time, those parameters should not be changed, otherwise you may get some very strange results. Afterwards, the method `compute_model` has the following input parameters:

```python
a = 0.85             # Semi-major axis of the disk in arcseconds
incl = 60.           # Inclination, in degrees
pa = 112.            # Position angle, in degrees
pin = 5.0            # Inner slope of the density distribution (>0)
pout = -15.0         # Outer slope of the density distribution (<0)
e = 0.1              # Eccentricity
omega = 85.          # Argument of periapsis, in degrees
gsca = 0.5           # Heinyey-Greenstein coefficient for total intensity
gpol = 0.5           # Heinyey-Greenstein coefficient for polarized intensity
opang = 0.03         # Opening angle of the disk, in radians
s11 = None           # Scattered light phase function
s12 = None           # Polarized light phase function
```

Most of the parameters are self-explanatory, except the last two, which allow the user to provide arrays for the shape of the phase function, either in total or polarized intensity. The arrays should have two dimensions, so that there can be a phase function for the north and south sides of the disk. For instance, if one wants to define an isotropic polarized phase function for both sides, then `s12` can be defined as `np.ones(shape=(nb,2))` where `nb` is the number of scattering angles between `0` and `180` degrees. If either `s11` or `s12` is provided, the code automatically define an array `disk.theta` containing the scattering angles (in radians). One should note that if the user only provides `s11` (or `s12`) the code will automatically assign an isotropic phase function for `s12` (or `s11`).

One should note that in the animation above, the scattered light phase function is slightly forward scattering, but the disk does not become much brighter as the inclination increases because the cuts are re-evaluated for each frame. But as one can see, the whole range of inclinations can be probed, and each image takes less than two seconds to be computed.
