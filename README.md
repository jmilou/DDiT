# DDiT
## Debris DIsks Tool

![screenshot](screenshots/DDiT.png)

A Python code to (quickly) produce synthetic images of debris disks, in total and polarized intensity using the Henyey-Greenstein approximation. In the model, the disk is not infinitely flat and while in principle it should work for any inclinations, at the moment, there are some **very** weird issues for large inclinations, and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.

To use the module, download the python files above and install it with the following (using the `develop` option so that any further changes are automatically included):
```python
python3 setup.py develop
```

Given that the code only uses matplotlib and numpy, it should work with python2 and python3. To compute a model, you can have a look at the end of the "DDiT.py" file, but in a nutshell, it is as simple as

```python
from DDiT import Disk
disk = Disk()
disk.compute_model(a = 0.6, i = 60., e = 0.3)
```

Alternatively, if you do not want to pass the arguments to the function (let's say you want to do some MCMC and want some liberty in choosing the free parameters), you can also do the following:

```python
from DDiT import Disk
disk = Disk()
disk.a = 0.6
disk.i = 60. * np.pi / 180.
disk.e = 0.3
disk.compute_model()
```
But in that case, you have to make sure that you put the angles in radians (and check the convention for how the position angle is defined). Once the model is computed, you will find the images in the variables `disk.intensity` and `disk.polarized` for the total and polarized intensity.
